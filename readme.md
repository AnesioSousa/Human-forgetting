# Self-Supervised Learning Project
This repository contains implementations of self-supervised learning methods: SimCLR, BYOL, and DINO.

## Directory Structure
- `datasets/`: Custom dataset handling.
- `models/`: Model architectures.
- `training/`: Training routines for each model.
- `utils/`: Utility scripts for augmentations, losses, and evaluations.
- `scripts/`: Scripts to train and evaluate models.

## Usage
- Run `scripts/run_simclr.py` to train the SimCLR model.
- Modify configuration files in `configs/` to change hyperparameters.
